<h1>Securing Linux File Permissions: Ensuring Exclusive Access for Researcher2</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved managing file permissions to ensure the researcher2 user had exclusive access to specific directories and files, including hidden files, in accordance with organizational security policies. Using the ls -la command, the project listed all files and directories, revealing ownership, permissions, and other metadata. Permissions were described in detail, highlighting the access levels for the owner, group, and others. The goal was to secure the environment by ensuring appropriate permissions for researcher2 while addressing potential security concerns, such as write-only access for the group and unrestricted access for others.
